# JacketSizePredictor-KRRModel
SmartJacketSizer-KRR is a ML model that predicts optimal jacket sizes based on user features such as age, height, and weight. Built using Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), the model provides accurate sizing recommendations by learning from real-world data. The project includes model training, evaluation (using RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error),
