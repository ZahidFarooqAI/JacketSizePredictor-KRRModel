# JacketSizePredictor-KRRModel
SmartJacketSizer-KRR
A machine learning project that predicts optimal jacket sizes based on user data such as age, height, and weight. Built using Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), the model delivers accurate sizing recommendations through hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (using RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error), and real-world prediction functionality.
Features:
Input: Age, Height (cm), Weight (kg)

Output: Jacket Size (inches)

Algorithm: Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)

Techniques: Hyperparameter Tuning (alpha, gamma), Data Scaling

Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn
